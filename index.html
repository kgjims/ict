        <p id="p3">The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education has revolutionized the way students learn and teachers teach. ICT can be used in various stages of assessment, such as test administration, scoring, analysis, and feedback. For instance, ICT can help teachers store and record information about how students are developing their understanding of new material. It can also take over some of the roles of assessing and providing feedback to students, allowing teachers to focus on other aspects of supporting learning. ICT can also be integrated into completing student tasks such as portfolio and project-based assessment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Enhanced Question Types</b> – Technology-based assessments allow for a variety of question types beyond the limited multiple-choice, true-or-false, or fill-in-the-blank options that have characterized traditional assessments.
                <ul>
                    <li>Examples of enhanced question types include the following
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>The graphic response, which includes any item to which students respond by drawing, moving, arranging, or selecting graphic regions.</i></li>
                            <li><i>Hot text, in which students select or rearrange sentences or phrases within a passage.</i></li>
                            <li><i>Performance-based assessments, in which students perform a series of complex tasks. Technology-enhanced questions allow students to demonstrate more complex thinking and share their understanding of the material in a way that was previously difficult to assess using traditional means.</i></li>
                            <li><i>Equation response, in which students respond by entering an equation.</i></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Provide Real-Time Feedback</b> – Technology-based formative assessments can offer real-time reporting of results, allowing stakeholders to understand students' strengths and weaknesses, while guiding them to make valid, actionable interpretations of the assessment data. Such assessments can enable educators to see, evaluate, and respond to students' work more quickly than can traditional assessments. Similarly, learners and their families can access this information almost in real-time. Technology based summative assessments also facilitate the faster turnaround of results.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Increase Accessibility</b> – Advances in technology grounded in Universal Design and systems that align to Universal Design for Learning (UDL) have made assessments more accessible and valid for a greater number of students, including those with diverse abilities and language capabilities. These advances have allowed a greater proportion of the population access to assessments. Special features include the ability to increase font sizes and change color contrast, text-to-speech, bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, and more. Similarly, assistive technology, such as text-to speech, alternate response systems, and refreshable braille, supports students with disabilities in accessing learning.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Adapt to Learner Ability and Knowledge</b> – Computer adaptive testing has facilitated the ability of assessments to estimate accurately what students know and can do across the curriculum in a shorter testing session than would otherwise be necessary. Computer adaptive testing uses algorithms to adjust the difficulty of questions throughout an assessment on the basis of a student's responses. For example, if the student answers a question correctly, a slightly more challenging item is presented next; if the student answers incorrectly, he or she receives another opportunity to demonstrate knowledge in a different manner.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Embedded With the Learning Process</b> – Embedded assessments are woven directly into the fabric of learning activities students undertake. Such assessments may be technology-driven or simply a part of effective instruction, and they may appear in digital learning tools and games. They are generally invisible to the instructional process because they are embedded in regular classroom activities. Embedded assessments have the potential to be useful for diagnostic and support purposes in that they provide insights into why students are having difficulties in mastering concepts and provide insights into how to personalize feedback to address these challenges.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Assessment for On-going Learning</b> – Technology provides students with multiple pathways to create accessible work throughout the year. To demonstrate their understanding, students can create multimedia productions, construct websites to organize and analyze information, and design interactive presentations to serve as products for assessment. These pathways allow teachers to understand how students access and understand information across given categories.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Computer as Scoring Tool</b> – One of the advantages of using a web-based exam software or an online examination system is that it gives a high level of transparency as opposed to the traditional method or remote method. It is almost impossible to compromise exam questions and evaluations because they cannot also be influenced. Most online exams generate their results instantly and it is often possible for the exam taker to get information on his results immediately. Some of the major advantages of online examination are: <br><i>(1) accessibility and flexibility; (2) time management; (3) save cost; and (4) statistical analysis.</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p3">It emphasizes the importance of schools strengthening their commitment to developing better assessment practices supported by ICT. It suggests that ICT can be used to create online assessments, provide real-time feedback, offer adaptive testing, increase accessibility for diverse students, provide assessment analytics for performance analysis, and support students in completing tasks that require higher-order thinking skills.</p>
        <p id="p3">In summary, ICT can play a significant role in assessment by providing teachers with tools to monitor student learning and provide feedback to both teachers and students.</p>
